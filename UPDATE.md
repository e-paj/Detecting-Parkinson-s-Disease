# What I have done so far:

September 28, 2021:
- I initially took the information of the data to see if there are any missing values.
- Then I took the statistical measures of each variable. 
- Then we group the data by status and took the mean of each variable. 
- I split the data variables into features(X) and Target(Y).
- Split X and Y into training and Test data.
- I standardized the data to a common range.
- Then made a SVM model.
- I evaluated the accuracy score of my models.
